# EADisplay
Simple PHP to display EAD-XML. This is still in development. If you'd like to help, please feel free to let me know. 

##The point of this
EAD-XML has been a standard for encoding archival material for some time, and there are plenty of ways to output this data on the web.
EADisplay offers another way. It's meant to be very simple, and suitable for archival repositories with little or no technical support.

##Using EADisplay
To use EADisplay you'll need access to a server running PHP.
1. Drop the directory on the server. 
2. Place your EAD files in the EAD directory.
3. Add options to the HTML form in the index file.

##To Do
1. Add PHP loop to auto feed EAD collection name/links to index file;
2. Finish adding EAD components to PHP print option;

##What EADisplay doesn't do
EADisplay is meant to be simple. It won't replace a fuller service for showing EAD contenct. For example, there's no built-in search function. 

#Thanks!
Thanks to the Wagner Free Institute of Science for donating sample EAD files for testing purpose.
